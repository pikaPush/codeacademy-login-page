# codeacademy-login-page

This is a simple login page of the codeacademy website I clone using HTML and CSS only. It's not functional yet, but it looks like the original page. I will add JavaScript functionality later.

The purpose of this project is to practice HTML and CSS skills, and to create a simple login page that resembles the original.
